## Modular Deep learning models

Modularity in Deep learning Models have become imperative due to the rapid growth in research and in the number of SOTA models being developed that are resource intensive and time consuming. The article deals with the popular techniques like distillation and quantization to understand and analyse the trends of how accuracy and model size is being affected.
